            <h2>What are human rights?</h2>
            <p>Human rights, as fundamental principles, are the bedrock of a just and humane society. They are not mere abstractions but practical guarantees essential for individuals to live with autonomy, security, and opportunity. These rights extend to encompass the right to privacy, freedom of movement, the right to work and fair wages, and the right to participate in cultural, artistic, and scientific endeavors. Moreover, they emphasize the protection of marginalized or vulnerable groups, including women, children, the elderly, and persons with disabilities.

              They stand as a shield against abuse and discrimination, ensuring that no one faces unjust treatment based on their identity or circumstances. Human rights frameworks actively promote diversity, encouraging societies to celebrate differences and cultivate environments where every individual's uniqueness is respected and valued.

              At their core, human rights aren't just legal or moral obligations; they represent a shared commitment to building societies founded on compassion, understanding, and fairness. They empower individuals to challenge injustices, advocate for change, and contribute to the creation of communities where human dignity is honored, and opportunities are accessible to all. Upholding these rights isn't a choice; it's a collective responsibility to create a world where everyone can live with dignity, equality, and freedom..</p>

            <h2>Why are humane rights important?</h2>
            <p>Human rights stand as the cornerstone of societal harmony and progress, encompassing a set of essential principles that safeguard the dignity, equality, and freedoms of individuals. Their paramount importance lies in providing a universal framework that transcends borders, cultures, and backgrounds, ensuring that every person enjoys inherent rights, irrespective of their status or identity. By upholding human rights, societies foster fairness, justice, and inclusivity, steering away from discrimination, oppression, and inequity.

              These rights serve as a protective shield, warding off potential abuses and injustices. They establish the norms for how individuals should be treated, guaranteeing the right to life, liberty, education, expression, and safeguarding against any form of discrimination, violence, or exploitation. Without the grounding force of human rights, societies risk descending into chaos, where certain groups might face marginalization or systematic disadvantage.

              Furthermore, the significance of human rights resonates globally, offering a common ground for shared values and aspirations. They bridge divides, advocating for fundamental needs such as safety, education, health, and participation in governance. Upholding human rights not only ensures the well-being of individuals but also nurtures environments conducive to growth, mutual respect, and collective progress across the world.

          <h2>So what are the human rights already established?</h2>
            <p>The established human rights are outlined in various international documents, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. Some of the key established human rights include:
